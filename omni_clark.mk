# This file is the build configuration for a full Android
# build for grouper hardware. This cleanly combines a set of
# device-specific aspects (drivers) with a device-agnostic
# product configuration (apps).

# Sample: This is where we'd set a backup provider if we had one
# $(call inherit-product, device/sample/products/backup_overlay.mk)

# Inherit 64-bit configs
$(call inherit-product, $(SRC_TARGET_DIR)/product/core_64_bit.mk)

# Get the prebuilt list of APNs
$(call inherit-product, vendor/omni/config/gsm.mk)

# Inherit from the common Open Source product configuration
$(call inherit-product, $(SRC_TARGET_DIR)/product/aosp_base_telephony.mk)

# Boot animation
TARGET_BOOTANIMATION_SIZE := 1440x814

# Inherit from our custom product configuration
$(call inherit-product, vendor/omni/config/common.mk)

# Enhanced NFC
#$(call inherit-product, vendor/cm/config/nfc_enhanced.mk)

# Inherit device configuration
$(call inherit-product, device/motorola/clark/device.mk)
